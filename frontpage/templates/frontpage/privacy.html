<h3>3. HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Information:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. We may share your Personal Information with vendors and other third-party providers who are performing services for the Company. In general, the vendors and third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide for the Company. For example, when you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery, or return a purchase, you consent to our collecting and using such personal information for that specific purpose, including by transmitting such information to our vendors (and their service providers) performing these services for the Company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment processors, have their own privacy policies in respect of the information that we are required to provide to them in order to use their services. For these third-party service providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so that you can understand the manner in which your Personal Information will be handled by such providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, we may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or if you violate our Terms of Use.</span></p>

<h3>4 TWITTER CONVERSION TRACKING AND TAILORED AUDIENCE</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On our website, we use the Conversion Tracking Service of Twitter Inc. (1355 Market Street #900, San Francisco, California 94103, &ldquo;Twitter&rdquo;). Twitter stores a cookie on the user&rsquo;s computer to enable an analysis of the use of our online products and services. Twitter Conversion Tracking tracks the actions of users after they have viewed ads or interacted with ads on Twitter. Twitter&rsquo;s Conversion Tracking allows you to assign conversions such as link clicks, retweets or &ldquo;like&rdquo; data. The legal basis for the use of this service is Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 letter f GDPR. If you wish to object to tracking, you can do so using the Digital Advertising Alliance tool at optout.aboutads.info. Twitter is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus guarantees its compliance with European data protection legislation: (</span><a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TORzAAO&amp;status=Active"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TORzAAO&amp;status=Active</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tailored audiences is the tool of Twitter Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA, www.twitter.com (&ldquo;Twitter&rdquo;), used to target existing users and customers to create remarketing campaigns. Targeting activity can include directly reaching out to users or visitors to the Omenics website and campaign pages and/or retargeting previous customer lists. Twitter sets a minimum size limit for a tailored audience to 500 users. If the tailored audience does not match 500 Twitter users, it will display as "audience too small" and will not be available for targeting. Details about Twitter&rsquo;s policies for conversion tracking and tailored audiences can be found at </span><a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/other-policy-requirements/policies-for-conversion-tracking-and-tailored-audiences.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/other-policy-requirements/policies-for-conversion-tracking-and-tailored-audiences.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3>5. FACEBOOK</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use Facebook&rsquo;s Software Development Kit (SDK) within our app. The Facebook SDK is issued and administered by Facebook. By means of this integration, we can link various Facebook services with our app. For example, this enables users to be able to use the Facebook SDK to share content from our apps within their Facebook timeline or to send messages to other Facebook users. Further information about the Facebook SDK within iOS can be found here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios. For Android, please refer to: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android. The legal basis for the storage of this data is Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 letter b GDPR. Facebook App Events: We use the Facebook App Events service though the Facebook SDK to track the reach of our advertising campaigns and the use of the Facebook SDK. Facebook merely provides us with an aggregated analysis of user behavior with our app. We have no influence beyond that on the information that will be processed through App Events by Facebook. Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus guarantees compliance with European data protection legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&amp;status=Active). The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 letter f GDPR. In our app settings, you can opt out of using App Events for these purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use the &ldquo;Custom Audience pixel&rdquo; of Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (&ldquo;Facebook&rdquo;) on our website. With its help, we can keep track of what users do after they see or click on a Facebook advertisement. This enables us to monitor the effectiveness of Facebook ads for purposes of statistics and market research. Data collected in this way is anonymous to us, which means we cannot see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is saved and processed by Facebook. Facebook can connect this data with your Facebook account and use it for its own advertising purposes, in accordance with Facebook&rsquo;s Data Policy which can be found at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. You can allow Facebook and its partners to place ads on and outside of Facebook. A cookie can also be saved on your device for these purposes. Please click here if you would like to withdraw your consent </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads#_=_"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads#_=_</span></a></p>
<h3>6. GOOGLE</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On our app we use the marketing and re-marketing services of Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; &ldquo;Google&rdquo;). These services allow us to display advertisements in a more targeted manner in order to present advertisements of interest to users. Through remarketing ads and products are displayed to users relating to an interest established by activity on other apps within the Google Network. For these purposes, a code is used by Google when our app is accessed and what are referred to as (re)marketing tags are incorporated into the app. With their help, an individual cookie, i.e. a small file, is stored on the user&rsquo;s device (comparable technologies may also be used instead of cookies). Cookies can be set by various domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com or googleadservices.com. This file records which apps users have visited, which content they are interested in and which offers have been used. In addition, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring apps, the length of the visit as well as any additional data about the use of the online products and services are stored. The IP address of users is also recorded, although we would like inform you that within the framework of Google Analytics, IP addresses within Member States of the European Union or in other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area are truncated. All user data will only be processed as pseudonymous data. Google does not store any names or e-mail addresses. All displayed ads are therefore not displayed specifically for a person, but for the owner of the cookie. This information is collected by Google and transmitted to and stored by servers in the USA. One of the Google marketing services we use is the online advertising program Google AdWords. In the case of Google AdWords, each AdWords customer receives a different conversion cookie. Cookies can therefore not be tracked through the apps of AdWords customers. The information collected by the cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. AdWords customers see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they will not receive any information that personally identifies users. We may include third-party advertisements based on the Google Marketing Service called DoubleClick. DoubleClick uses cookies to enable Google and its partner apps to place ads based on users&rsquo; visits to this app or other apps on the Internet. Google services make use of Google&rsquo;s Tag Manager. For more information about Google&rsquo;s use of data for marketing purposes, please see the summary page: https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads, Google&rsquo;s privacy policy is available at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy The legal basis for the use of this service is Article Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 letter f GDPR. If you wish to object to interest-based advertising by Google marketing services, you can do so using the settings and opt-out options provided by Google: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences. Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus guarantees compliance with European data protection legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, www.google.com (&ldquo;Google Analytics&rdquo; or &ldquo;Google&rdquo;). Google Analytics employs cookies that are stored to your computer in order to facilitate an analysis of your use of the site. The information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and frequency of your visits to our site, including your IP address, is transmitted to Google&rsquo;s location in the US and stored there. In using Google Analytics our website employs the extension &ldquo;anonymizeIp&rdquo;. In doing so, Google abbreviates and thereby anonymizes your IP address before transferring it from EU/EEA member states. Google uses this information to analyze your use of our site, to compile reports for us on internet activity and to provide other services relating to our website. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law or where such third parties process this data on Google&rsquo;s behalf. Google states that it will in never associate your IP address with other data held by Google. You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly as noted elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website. Google Analytics also offers a deactivation add-on for most current browsers that provides you with more control over what data Google can collect on websites you access. The add-on tells the JavaScript (ga.js) used by Google Analytics not to transmit any information about website visits to Google Analytics. However, the browser deactivation add-on offered by Google Analytics does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analysis services we may engage. Google Analytics also uses electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used. You can find additional information on how to install the browser add-on referenced above at the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. For the cases in which personal data is transferred to the US, Google has self-certified pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield (https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework). 12.8 Google Tag Manager (GTM) Google Tag Manager (GTM&rdquo;) is a tag management system to manage JavaScript and HTML tags used for tracking and analytics on websites. Tags are small code elements that, among other things, are used to measure traffic and visitor behaviour: to understand the effect of online advertising and social channels; to set up remarketing and orientation towards target groups; and to test and optimize websites. GTM makes it easier for us to integrate and manage our tags.</span></p>
